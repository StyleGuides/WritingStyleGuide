          InfiniBand is a switched fabric network topology used in high-performance computing. The term is both a service mark and a trademark of the InfiniBand Trade Association. Their rules for using the mark are standard ones: append the ™ symbol the first time it is used and respect the capitalization (including the inter-capped "B") from then on. In ASCII-only circumstances, the "(TM)" string is the acceptable alternative.
        </para>
         <para>
          "Open InfiniBand" is deprecated and should not be used.

       <listitem>
        <para>
          Correct. Stands for input/output (pronounced "eye-oh"). The term I/O is used to describe any program, operation or device that transfers data to or from a computer and to or from a peripheral device. Every transfer is an output from one device and an input into another. Devices such as keyboards and mice are input-only devices, while devices such as printers are output-only. A writable CD is both an input and an output device.
        </para>
         <para>
          The term I/O is a non-countable noun. Append "operations" in order to refer to multiple units of I/O. For example: I/O operations could not be recovered in situations where I/O should have been temporarily queued, such as when paths were unavailable.

      <term>IP Masquerade</term>
       <listitem>
        <para>
          A Linux networking function. IP Masquerade, also called IPMASQ or MASQ, allows one or more computers in a network without assigned IP addresses to communicate with the internet using the Linux server's assigned IP address. The IPMASQ server acts as a gateway, and the other devices are invisible behind it, so to other machines on the internet the outgoing traffic appears to be coming from the IPMASQ server and not the internal PCs.
        </para>
         <para>
          Because IPMASQ is a generic technology, the server can be connected to other computers through LAN technologies such as Ethernet, Token Ring, and FDDI, as well as dial-up connections such as PPP or SLIP.

          A new type of IP routing developed by Ipsilon Networks, Inc. Unlike conventional routers, IP switching routers use ATM hardware to speed packets through networks. Although the technology is new, it appears to be considerably faster than older router techniques.

      <term>Itanium</term>
       <listitem>
        <para>
          A member of Intel's Merced family of processors, Itanium is a 64-bit RISC microprocessor. Based on the EPIC (Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing) design philosophy, which states that the compiler should decide which instructions be executed together, Itanium has the highest FPU power available.
        </para>
         <para>
          In 64-bit mode, Itanium is able to calculate two bundles of a maximum of three instructions at a time. In 32-bit mode, it is much slower. Decoders must first translate 32-bit instruction sets into 64-bit instruction sets, which results in extra-clock cycle use.
        </para>
         <para>
          Itanium's primary use is driving large applications that require more than 4 GB of memory, such as databases, ERP, and future internet applications.
