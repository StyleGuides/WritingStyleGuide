		The objective of the Red&nbsp;Hat Style Guide is to help authors communicate information in a clear, transparent fashion, and to facilitate consistency in tone and delivery. We write documentation for a variety of audiences, across multiple geographies and with very different skill sets. We write for end users as well as expert users. Red&nbsp;Hat documentation is:

		 <para>
			Technical documents should be readable by the targeted audience. In this instance, we expect our audiences to have the minimum reading and comprehension level of an eighth-grade student, of an age between 14 and 15 years. The Flesch-Kincaid and Gunning Fog index provide measurable grades. A Red&nbsp;Hat guide should have a Gunning Fog index of 9-12.
