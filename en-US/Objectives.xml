		The objective of the Red&nbsp;Hat Style Guide is to help authors communicate information in a clear, transparent fashion, and to facilitate consistency in tone and delivery.
    We write documentation for various audiences, across multiple geographies and with different skill sets.
    We write for end users as well as expert users.
    Red&nbsp;Hat documentation is:

		<title>Readability</title>
		 <para>
			Technical documents should be readable by the targeted audience.
      In this instance, we expect our audiences to have the minimum reading and comprehension level of an eighth-grade student, of an age between 14 and 15 years.
      The Flesch-Kincaid and Gunning Fog index provide measurable grades.
      A Red&nbsp;Hat guide should have a Gunning Fog index of 9-12.
