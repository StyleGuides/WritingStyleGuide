						</listitem>

					</itemizedlist>
					 <para>
						A comma can be omitted from a sentence with several clauses, but only when there's little chance that the sentence could be misread without it:
					</para>
					 <itemizedlist>
						<listitem>
							<para>
								We played football all afternoon and were completely exhausted but we still stayed up watching movies all night.
							</para>

						</listitem>

						That sentence is fine, but adding a comma before "...but we still stayed up..." would provide a pause and avoid the chance of having it read like a run-on sentence.
					</para>
					 <para>
						In a compound sentence containing several short independent clauses, separate the clauses with commas AND USE A COMMA BEFORE THE CONJUNCTION:

		<title>Parentheses</title>
		 <para>
			Parentheses are similar to commas in that they set off information that further explains or enhances a statement. Information that is very closely related to the statement should be set off with commas; information that is more incidental should be set off with parentheses.

		 <para>
			A word or words being introduced to readers should not be placed in quotation marks (for our purposes, we use the SGML &lt;firstterm&gt; tag) for first reference. If you are writing outside of the SGML tagging enviroment, use quotation marks for first references. Subsequent references do not need quotation marks or the &lt;firstterm&gt; SGML tag.
