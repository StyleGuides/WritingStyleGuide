			In technical documentation, place punctuation marks, including periods, commas, question marks, exclamation points, dashes, and semicolons inside the quotation marks if they are part of the quotation or part of a programming element that uses quotation marks; if not, place punctuation marks outside the quotation marks. 
			If a sentence ends with a quotation, use only one punctuation mark to end the sentence, and place it inside the closing quotation mark if it is part of the quotation, or outside if it is not.
