			 <listitem>
				<para>
					A condition in which an operating system or other service gives user access to a remote resource through a network without needing to know if the resource is remote or local. For example, Sun Microsystems NFS, now a de facto industry standard, provides access to shared files through the Virtual File System (VFS) interface that runs on top of the TCP/IP stack. Users can manipulate shared files as if they were stored locally on the user's own hard disk.

			<term>NFS</term>
			 <listitem>
				<para>
					Abbreviation of Network File System, a client/server application designed by Sun Microsystems that provides access for all network users to shared files stored on computers of different types. NFS provides access to shared files through the Virtual File System (VFS) interface that runs in a layer above TCP/IP. Users can manipulate shared files as if they were stored locally on the user's own hard disk.
				</para>
				 <para>
					With NFS, computers that are connected to a network operate as clients while accessing remote files, and as servers while providing remote users access to local shared files. The NFS standards are publicly available and widely used.
