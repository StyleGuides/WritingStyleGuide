 			<term>named</term>
 			 <listitem>
 				<para>
					When referring to the designation of files, objects, or entities within documentation, use the term "named" instead of "called". 
					This choice promotes clarity and precision in technical content.
					The word "named" directly associates the name with the entity and is more specific in technical contexts. 
					Use "named" to refer to such items as a file, directory, task, user, or group.
					For example, "When you need to store configuration settings, create a directory named <filename>configurations</filename> to keep your workspace organized."
 				</para>
				 <para>
					On the other hand, "called" can imply a more casual or informal reference and might introduce ambiguity, because it can also mean "invoked" in the context of functions or methods.
 				</para>
				 <para>
					Refer also to <xref linkend="called" />.

		 <varlistentry id="navigate-to">
 			<term>navigate to</term>
 			 <listitem>
 				<para>
					Use "go to", in preference to "navigate to", for directing readers to a location, including when moving through multiple UI options, to cover all cases where you might have to click, point to, select, or otherwise make a series of selections to initiate an action.
          			For example, "Go to the student user's home directory."
					It is acceptable to use the noun form, "navigation", for example "navigation through the interface".
 				</para>
				<para>
					Refer to <xref linkend="go-to" />.

		 <varlistentry id="network-transparency">
			<term>network transparency</term>
			 <listitem>
				<para>
					A condition in which an operating system or other service gives user access to a remote resource through a network without needing to know if the resource is remote or local. For example, Sun Microsystems NFS, now a de facto industry standard, provides access to shared files through the Virtual File System (VFS) interface that runs on top of the TCP/IP stack. Users can manipulate shared files as if they were stored locally on the user's own hard disk.
				</para>

			</listitem>

		</varlistentry>
		 <varlistentry id="nfs">
			<term>NFS</term>
			 <listitem>
				<para>
					Abbreviation of Network File System, a client/server application designed by Sun Microsystems that provides access for all network users to shared files stored on computers of different types.
          NFS provides access to shared files through the Virtual File System (VFS) interface that runs in a layer above TCP/IP.
          Users can manipulate shared files as if they were stored locally on the user's own hard disk.
				</para>
				 <para>
					With NFS, computers that are connected to a network operate as clients while accessing remote files, and as servers while providing remote users access to local shared files.
          The NFS standards are publicly available and widely used.
				</para>

			<term>node</term>
			 <listitem>
				<orderedlist>
					<listitem>
						<para>
							In networks, a processing location. A node can be a computer or some other device such as a printer. Every node has a unique network address, sometimes called a Data Link Control (DLC) address or a Media Access Control (MAC) address.
						</para>

					 <listitem>
						<para>
							In tree structures, a point where two or more lines meet.

			<term>nonsecure</term>
			 <listitem>
				<para>
					Do not use. Use "insecure" instead.
				</para>

		 <varlistentry id="null">
			<term>NULL or null</term>
			 <listitem>
				<para>
					When a command or value is stated, use NULL. When stating that something is null, use "null", all lowercase.
				</para>

			</listitem>

		</varlistentry>
		 <varlistentry id="number-sign">
			<term>number sign</term>
			 <listitem>
				<para>
					Generally, use "number sign" to refer to the # character.
          Otherwise, use "hash" to refer to a hashtag in social media, or to refer to Secure Hash Algorithm (refer to <xref linkend="sha" />), or when writing exclusively for a European audience.
          You can instead use "pound sign" when writing exclusively for a North American audience, if "number sign" is not appropriate for the context.
