	<title>Avoiding Slang, Metaphors, and Misleading Language</title>
	 <para>
		Red&nbsp;Hat produces documentation for a global audience, and in many cases this documentation is translated into many languages. To reach the widest possible audience, and to make the task of translation as straight-forward as possible, it is necessary to avoid slang and other culture-specific terminology. This section attempts to identify commonly-used slang terms and phraseology, and to provide alternatives.
	</para>
	 <para>
		If you find slang terms or other difficult-to-understand passages in our documentation, use this page to search for alternatives. You can also raise bugs directly in Bugzilla, under the product heading "Red&nbsp;Hat Style Guide."

				<term>best practices</term>

				<term>first come, first served</term>
				 <listitem>
					<para>
						Use to indicate that customers will be attended to in the order that they arrive. The phrase abbreviates the sentence&mdash;The first to come is the first to be served&mdash;so use "served" instead of "serve" to keep the verb function the same. This phrase is an idiom, so avoid using it when content will be translated. When you use this phrase as an adjective, it is hyphenated as follows: Admittance is on a first-come, first-served basis.

						"To frown upon" means to hold in low regard, not to approve of, etc. This appeared in the Seam guide: "...we generally frown on the use of session context...". This translates to (and should have been written as) "...the use of session context is not recommended..." (or words to that effect).

					 <itemizedlist>
						<listitem>
							<para>
								In Directory Server, if you do a fuzzy search for "Smith" you will probably also get "Smyth," because it sounds the same.
							</para>

						</listitem>

					</itemizedlist>
					 <para>
						The use of "fuzzy" is valid in this context.
					</para>
					 <para>
						Note the difference between this and "wildcard" searches: "Sm?th" could return "Smith," "Smyth," "Smeth," or even "Smrth."
					</para>
					 <para>
						Do not use "fuzzy" to describe something that is not clear, such as an image, a concept, an idea, and so on. For example, "He was a bit fuzzy on the details" is not valid.

				<term>have a crack at/jump right in</term>
				 <listitem>
					<para>
						Have a crack at and jump right in are closely related in meaning as they imply to "get started or give it a try." Alternatives to these are "start," "try," and "begin," and will depend on the context of what is being discussed.

					<para>
						Avoid using this term, because 1) it is jargon, 2) not everyone knows what it means, and 3) the meaning could be lost or confused in translation to other languages.
					</para>
					 <para>
						Typically used to mean maintaining the <foreignphrase>status quo</foreignphrase> or just doing what is required to keep things up and running (versus being proactive and innovative).

						Commonly used in expressions such as "password information is sent in plain text over the wire," meaning "sent unencrypted through the transmission medium" (whether it is a wired or wireless network, the Internet, or whatever). The phrase is probably not required at all. "Sent/transmitted in plain text" is fine.

				 <listitem>
					<para>
						To "shoot yourself in the foot" indicates that you have done something to harm your own cause, or acting against your own best interests. Remove the sentence - it should be self-evident from the surrounding information. (Found this statement alongside the "double-edged sword" comment with an added note about "preserving all your toes.")

				<term>shy of</term>
				 <listitem>
					<para>
						Apart from the "normal" meaning of shy, it is also found in such phrases as "he was just shy of the mark," meaning that he didn't quite succeed. Also, to be "a few items shy of what's required" means to have less than the minimum number required. Avoid this terminology and use more easily understood terms; it will help our translators and also those reading our English documentation who are unfamiliar with such slang.

						This refers to something being out of plain sight or not immediately obvious. For example, you might only see the results of some action or command, but what happens "under the covers" is what is going on in the background, that you can't see or are not aware of, to make that action of command possible.

						This refers to a group of blind-folded people all touching different parts of an elephant and trying to describe what it is. Nobody sees the "big picture." Curiously, it appeared in an STC article about working in global and virtual teams and using effective communication. It falls into the same category as "skeletons in the closet," "dark horse," "black sheep," and so on. Use descriptions and adjectives that are not specific to a particular culture or locale.

		<title>Neologisms (Invented Words)</title>
		 <para>
			The English language is full of these. Some of them are useful, some of them are less so, others are just painful, difficult to translate, and should be avoided. Many of them are the result of creating nouns from verbs, verbs from nouns, and adjectives from just about anything. Unless a particular word has been in use for some time and has been generally accepted into common English, try to avoid these neologisms. If necessary, reword or restructure your sentences.
