	<title>Avoiding Slang, Metaphors, and Misleading Language</title>
	 <para>
		Red&nbsp;Hat produces documentation for a global audience, and in many cases this documentation is translated into many languages. To reach the widest possible audience, and to make the task of translation as straightforward as possible, it is necessary to avoid slang and other culture-specific terminology. This section attempts to identify commonly-used slang terms and phraseology, and to provide alternatives.
	</para>
	 <para>
		If you find slang terms or other difficult-to-understand passages in our documentation, use this page to search for alternatives. You can also raise bugs directly in Bugzilla, under the product heading "Red&nbsp;Hat Style Guide."

		<title>Avoiding Misleading or Confusing Language</title>
		 <para>
			Some terms, phrases, and general language can be confusing if you are not a native speaker or if the phraseology has regional significance. Sometimes spelling changes are introduced over time and regions based purely on differences in pronunciation. Some phrases can carry hidden or unintentional meanings. This section attempts to introduce a few examples.

				<term>best practices</term>
				 <listitem>
					<para>
						This is a commonly understood phrase, and despite some concerns about using superlatives without statistics to back them up, Red&nbsp;Hat does not actively discourage their use. It is also a more common search term than most alternatives. If you are in any doubt, the preferred alternative is "recommended practices."

				<term>first come, first served</term>
				 <listitem>
					<para>
						Use to indicate that customers will be attended to in the order that they arrive. The phrase abbreviates the sentence "The first to come is the first to be served," so use "served" instead of "serve" to keep the verb function the same. This phrase is an idiom, so avoid using it when content will be translated. When you use this phrase as an adjective, it is hyphenated as follows: Admittance is on a first-come, first-served basis.

					</para>
					 <para>
						Note the difference between this and "wildcard" searches: "Sm?th" could return "Smith," "Smyth," "Smeth," or even "Smrth."
					</para>
					 <para>
						Do not use "fuzzy" to describe something that is not clear, such as an image, a concept, an idea, and so on. For example, "He was a bit fuzzy on the details" is not valid.

Also, to be "a few items shy of what's required" means to have less than the minimum number required. Avoid this terminology and use more easily understood terms; it will help our translators and also those reading our English documentation who are unfamiliar with such slang.

						This refers to something being out of plain sight or not immediately obvious. For example, you might only see the results of some action or command, but what happens "under the covers" is what is going on in the background, that you can't see or are not aware of, to make that action of command possible.

					<para>
						This refers to a group of blind-folded people all touching different parts of an elephant and trying to describe what it is. Nobody sees the "big picture." Curiously, it appeared in an STC article about working in global and virtual teams and using effective communication. It falls into the same category as "skeletons in the closet," "dark horse," "black sheep," and so on. Use descriptions and adjectives that are not specific to a particular culture or locale. See <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_Men_and_an_Elephant">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_Men_and_an_Elephant</ulink> for more information.

		<title>Neologisms (Invented Words)</title>
		 <para>
			The English language is full of these. Some of them are useful, some of them are less so, others are just painful, difficult to translate, and should be avoided. Many of them are the result of creating nouns from verbs, verbs from nouns, and adjectives from just about anything. Unless a particular word has been in use for some time and has been generally accepted into common English, try to avoid these neologisms. If necessary, reword or restructure your sentences.
