				<para>
					<emphasis>n.</emphasis> Use "air gap" to describe systems that are separated, not by software, but physically. Do not use "air wall." "Air gap" is preferred in technical publications because there is no actual wall that you need to breach, but rather a gap that you need to bridge. You cannot break through something that does not exist.

			<term>acronyms</term>
			 <listitem>
				<para>
					An acronym is a word formed from the initial letters of a name, such as ROM for <emphasis>R</emphasis>ead <emphasis>O</emphasis>nly <emphasis>M</emphasis>emory, or by combining initial letters or part of a series of words, such as LILO for <emphasis>LI</emphasis>nux <emphasis>LO</emphasis>ader.
          Note that an acronym is pronounced as a word.
          Compare this to an initialism, which is also formed in a similar fashion to an acronym, but in which each letter is pronounced separately.
				</para>
				 <para>
					Spell out most acronyms and initialisms before using them in text, such as "The Embedded DevKit (EDK)..."
          Unless the acronym or initialism stands for a proper noun, use sentence case for the spelled out version - for example, "central processing unit (CPU)."
          Unless required for the audience or the topic, do not spell out well-known abbreviations, such as HTML.
				</para>
				 <para>
					To form the plural of an acronym, add a trailing, lowercase "s," or "es," for example, ROMs, PINs, BIOSes.

      <term>architect</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          Do not use as a verb.
          Even though it might make sense in the correct context, using it as a verb can be jargon or be unclear for your audience.
          Use "design," "build," "create," or another descriptive verb instead.
          Before replacing the verb form of "architect" during the editing process, clarify with the writer the intended meaning.
          For example, a sentence that mentions rearchitecting might require "refactoring" as a replacement rather than "rebuilding."

		 <varlistentry id="as-well-as">
			<term role="caution">as well as</term>
			 <listitem>
				<para>
					Not interchangeable with "and."
          "As well as" used in a series places more emphasis on the items preceding it, whereas "and" places equal weight on all items in the series.
          For example, "We sell kitchen electronics and china, as well as some gourmet foods."
          But "We sell kitchen electronics, china, and silverware."

						<para>
							Capitalize the noun (such as Platform, Software, Infrastructure) and Service, both when abbreviated and when written out.

							Hyphenate when written out: Thing-as-a-Service.
              For two-word prefixes, do not include a hyphen between the first and second words, for example: Mobile Backend-as-a-Service.
              It can be used as an adjective to describe multiple: for example, when referring to IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS, use as-a-Service offerings, as-a-Service products, or similar wording.
						</para>

					</listitem>
					 <listitem>

							Avoid use of an acronym if it could stand for more than one term in a single asset. for example, if you are writing content that discusses both Cloud-as-a-Service and Containers-as-a-Service.
