	<title>Grammar</title>
	 <para>
		This section contains information on a few common grammar topics. For subjects not covered here, consult The Chicago Manual of Style, 16th Edition.
	</para>
	 <section id="sect-Red_Hat_Technical_Publications-Writing_Style_Guide-Grammar-Active_Voice">
		<title>Active Voice</title>
		 <para>
			Use the active voice ("Type ... to start Linuxconf.") rather than passive ("Linuxconf can be started by typing...") whenever possible. Active voice makes for more lively, interesting reading. It is more compelling than passive voice and helps to reduce word count.
		</para>
		 <para>
			This does not mean that the passive voice is forbidden. There are situations when using the passive voice is appropriate, such as release notes, technical notes, and similar material.
		</para>
		 <para>
			For example, the sentence, "The Developer Center, a site for reference material and other resources, has been introduced to the OpenShift website." reads better than
		</para>
		 <para>
			"The OpenShift website introduces the Developer Center, a site for reference material and other resources." Here, the passive voice is better because the important issue ("The Developer Center") is the subject of the sentence.
		</para>
		 <para>
			You can also use the passive voice to front-load important keywords in key areas of your content, such as the title, heading, or at the beginning of a paragraph or sentence. You need to make these decisions on a case-by-case basis, weighing the importance of front-loading keywords against content that is readable (that is, not awkward sounding). Consider the following two examples:
		</para>
		 <example id="exam-Red_Hat_Technical_Publications-Writing_Style_Guide-Active_Voice-Active_Voice">
			<title>Active Voice</title>
			 <para>
				"Dutch hosting provider Oxilion launches <emphasis>public cloud</emphasis> service based on Red&nbsp;Hat Enterprise&nbsp;Virtualization."
			</para>

		</example>

	 <section id="sect-Red_Hat_Technical_Publications-Writing_Style_Guide-Grammar-Agreement">
		<title>Agreement</title>
		 <para>
			In grammar, agreement occurs when specific parts of a sentence are coordinated; that is, they agree in number and gender.
		</para>
		 <para>
			There are two forms of agreement: <emphasis>subject-verb agreement</emphasis> and <emphasis>pronoun-antecedent agreement</emphasis>. Subject-verb agreement is pretty rudimentary, and is not discussed here. Pronoun-antecedent agreement can be a little more problematic, so...
		</para>
		 <section id="sect-Red_Hat_Technical_Publications-Writing_Style_Guide-Agreement-Pronoun_antecedent_agreement">
			<title>Pronoun-antecedent agreement</title>
			 <para>
				A <emphasis>pronoun</emphasis> is a word that is used in place of a noun (for example, I, he, she, it). An <emphasis>antecedent</emphasis> is a word or phrase to which the pronoun refers.
			</para>
			 <para>
				When you are comfortable with subject-verb agreement, pronoun-antecedent agreement often follows as a matter of course.
			</para>
			 <para>
				The following is an annotated roundup of pronoun-antecedent rules:

			 <formalpara id="form-Red_Hat_Technical_Publications-Writing_Style_Guide-Pronoun_antecedent_agreement-Singular_and_Plural_Nouns">
				<title>Singular and Plural Nouns</title>
				 <para>
					A singular pronoun refers to a singular antecedent; a plural pronoun refers to a plural antecedent. For example:
				</para>

			</formalpara>
			 <itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						The CD spins in <emphasis>its</emphasis> caddy. (The singular third-person pronoun "its" refers to the singular antecedent "CD".)
					</para>

				</listitem>
				 <listitem>
					<para>
						The developers checked <emphasis>their</emphasis> work. (The plural third-person pronoun "their" refers to the plural antecedent "developers".)

				</listitem>

			</itemizedlist>
			 <formalpara id="form-Red_Hat_Technical_Publications-Writing_Style_Guide-Pronoun_antecedent_agreement-Collective_Nouns">
				<title>Collective Nouns</title>
				 <para>
					When collective nouns are used as antecedents, use singular or plural pronouns, depending on the sentence's meaning. For example:
				</para>

			</formalpara>
			 <itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Microsoft seems second to none in <emphasis>its</emphasis> marketing skills. (The collective noun "Microsoft" takes the singular pronoun "its" because the collective noun refers to the group as a whole.)
					</para>

				</listitem>
				 <listitem>
					<para>
						The developers were asked for <emphasis>their</emphasis> preferences. (The collective noun "developers" takes the plural pronoun "their" because the reference is to the individuals of the group.)

			Use "whom" or "who" to introduce a qualifying phrase when the antecedent is a person. Use "that" or "which" when referring to a thing. Use "which" or "that" to introduce a qualifying phrase when the antecedent is a concept or an object. Who, whom, that, and which are known as "relative pronouns."

		<title>Gender References</title>
		 <para>
			Do not use gender-specific pronouns in documentation. It is far less awkward to read a sentence that uses "they" and "their" rather than "he/she" and "his/hers." In most cases, use "you" when giving instructions, and "the user," "new users," and so on in more general explanations. Do not use "one" in place of "you" when writing technical documentation. Using "one" is far too formal.

		<title>Tense</title>
		 <para>
			Avoid future tense (or using the term "will") whenever possible. For example, future tense ("The screen will display...") does not read as well as the present tense ("The screen displays..."). Remember, the users you are writing for most often refer to the documentation while they are using the system, not after or in advance of using the system.
		</para>
		 <para>
			Use simple present tense as much as possible. It avoids problems with consequences and time related communications, and is the easiest tense for translation.
