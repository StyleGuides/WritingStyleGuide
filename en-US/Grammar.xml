	<title>Grammar</title>
	 <para>
		This section contains information on a few common grammar topics. For subjects not covered here, consult The Chicago Manual of Style, 17th Edition.
	</para>
	 <section id="active-voice">
		<title>Active Voice</title>
		 <para>
			Use the active voice ("Type ... to start Linuxconf") rather than passive ("Linuxconf can be started by typing ...") whenever possible. Active voice makes for more lively, interesting reading. It is more compelling than passive voice and helps to reduce word count.
		</para>
		 <para>
			This does not mean that the passive voice is forbidden. There are situations when using the passive voice is appropriate, such as release notes, technical notes, and similar material.
		</para>
		 <para>
			For example, the sentence, "The Developer Center, a site for reference material and other resources, has been introduced to the OpenShift website." reads better than
		</para>
		 <para>
			"The OpenShift website introduces the Developer Center, a site for reference material and other resources." Here, the passive voice is better because the important issue ("The Developer Center") is the subject of the sentence.
		</para>
		 <para>
			You can also use the passive voice to front-load important keywords in key areas of your content, such as the title, heading, or at the beginning of a paragraph or sentence. You need to make these decisions on a case-by-case basis, weighing the importance of front-loading keywords against content that is readable (that is, not awkward sounding). Consider the following two examples:
		</para>
		 <example id="active-voice-example">
			<title>Active Voice</title>
			 <para>
				"Dutch hosting provider Oxilion launches <emphasis>public cloud</emphasis> service based on Red&nbsp;Hat Enterprise&nbsp;Virtualization."
			</para>

		</example>
		 <example id="passive-voice-example">
			<title>Passive Voice</title>
			 <para>
				"<emphasis>Public cloud</emphasis> service based on Red&nbsp;Hat Enterprise&nbsp;Virtualization launched by Dutch hosting provider Oxilion."
			</para>

		</example>

	 <section id="agreement">
		<title>Agreement</title>
		 <para>
			In grammar, agreement occurs when specific parts of a sentence are coordinated; that is, they agree in number and gender.
		</para>
		 <para>
			There are two forms of agreement: <emphasis>subject-verb agreement</emphasis> and <emphasis>pronoun-antecedent agreement</emphasis>. Subject-verb agreement is pretty rudimentary, and is not discussed here. Pronoun-antecedent agreement can be a little more problematic, so...
		</para>
		 <section id="pronoun-antecedent-agreement">
			<title>Pronoun-antecedent agreement</title>
			 <para>
				A <emphasis>pronoun</emphasis> is a word that is used in place of a noun (for example, I, he, she, it). An <emphasis>antecedent</emphasis> is a word or phrase to which the pronoun refers.
			</para>
			 <para>
				When you are comfortable with subject-verb agreement, pronoun-antecedent agreement often follows as a matter of course.
			</para>
			 <para>
				The following is an annotated roundup of pronoun-antecedent rules:
			</para>
			 <formalpara id="singular-plural-nouns">
				<title>Singular and Plural Nouns</title>
				 <para>
					A singular pronoun refers to a singular antecedent; a plural pronoun refers to a plural antecedent. For example:
				</para>

			</formalpara>
			 <itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						The CD spins in <emphasis>its</emphasis> caddy. (The singular third-person pronoun "its" refers to the singular antecedent "CD".)
					</para>

				</listitem>
				 <listitem>
					<para>
						The developers checked <emphasis>their</emphasis> work. (The plural third-person pronoun "their" refers to the plural antecedent "developers".)
					</para>

				</listitem>

			</itemizedlist>
			 <formalpara id="collective-nouns">
				<title>Collective Nouns</title>
				 <para>
					When collective nouns are used as antecedents, use singular or plural pronouns, depending on the sentence's meaning. For example:
				</para>

			</formalpara>
			 <itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Microsoft seems second to none in <emphasis>its</emphasis> marketing skills. (The collective noun "Microsoft" takes the singular pronoun "its" because the collective noun refers to the group as a whole.)
					</para>

				</listitem>
				 <listitem>
					<para>
						The developers were asked for <emphasis>their</emphasis> preferences. (The collective noun "developers" takes the plural pronoun "their" because the reference is to the individuals of the group.)
					</para>

				</listitem>

			</itemizedlist>

		</section>

	</section>
	 <section id="countable-nouns">
		<title>Countable Nouns</title>
		 <para>
			For nouns that are not countable, it is correct to use "less" and "amount", for example "less memory" or "the required amount of memory".
			For nouns that are countable, use "fewer" instead of "less", and use "number" instead of "amount".

			Consider the following points when constructing sentences:
		</para>
		
		 <formalpara id="length">
			<title>Sentence Length</title>
			 <para>
				Try not to pack too much information into one sentence.
        In technical documentation, try not to exceed 40 words in a sentence.
        Keep it short.
        The following sentence is a bad writing example:
			</para>

		</formalpara>
		 <para>
			The <guibutton>Start</guibutton> button, which you can find in the bottom left corner of your screen (also activated by the "Windows key" on your keyboard, the one between the <keycap>Ctrl</keycap> and <keycap>Alt</keycap> keys), provides a central starting point for applications and tasks, and can be customized according to your individual preferences so that it presents menu items relevant to you instead of presenting the standard items that come with the default installation of the operating system, items which, in my opinion, are irrelevant for most users these days who really only need access to an internet browser such as Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox.
		</para>

		 <formalpara id="preposition">
			<title>Preposition at the End of a Sentence</title>
			 <para>
				Allow a preposition at the end of a sentence to avoid otherwise awkward wording.
			</para>

		</formalpara>
		 <para>
			For example, instead of "Click the workspace to which you want to switch", which can sound stilted, it flows better to use "Click the workspace to switch to".

		 <formalpara id="run-on">
			<title>Run-on Sentences</title>
			 <para>
				Two or more complete ideas that are joined without punctuation, or separated only by a comma, create a <emphasis>run-on sentence</emphasis> (also called a <emphasis>fused sentence</emphasis>).

          Think of a semicolon as an extended breather; it is longer than a comma.
				</para>

		<title>Hyphenation</title>
		 <para>
			No hard and fast rules exist for hyphenation.
      In general, do not hyphenate unless required for clarity, or your other references declare that hyphens are required.
      The following is general guidance; if you are unsure about whether to hyphenate, ask your peers.
      See also the "Hyphens" topic in the <citetitle>IBM Style Guide</citetitle>.
		</para>
		
		 <formalpara id="hyphenate-for-clarity">
			<title>Hyphenate for Clarity</title>
			 <para>
				Hyphenate when needed for clarity. Words that begin with prefixes are usually not hyphenated. Prefixes can include "multi", "non", "sub", "co", "semi", "pre", "re", and so on. The same applies to suffixes; for example, "less" as a suffix does not require hyphenation.
			</para>

		</formalpara>
		 <note>
			<para>
				Always use a hyphen if clarity would suffer otherwise. For example, "He recovered his health" versus "He re-covered the leaky roof."<footnote> <para>

		 <formalpara id="hyphenate-complex-adjectives">
			<title>Hyphenate Complex Adjectives</title>
			 <para>
				Hyphenate complex adjectives (compound modifiers). This is when two adjectives work together to modify an object. The hyphen is used when the first adjective modifies the second adjective. For example, cloud-based solutions, right-side paralysis, systemwide menu.
			</para>

		</formalpara>
		 <note>
			<para>
				Do not hyphenate "open source", even when used as a complex adjective.
			</para>
			 <para>
				Do not hyphenate a compound that includes an adverb that ends in <emphasis>-ly</emphasis>, whether it comes before or after the noun, because it is never ambiguous. This is described in Chicago Manual of Style 7.82. For example, "Red&nbsp;Hat Enterprise Linux is a production-ready, commercially supported Linux distribution."
			</para>

		</note>
		 <formalpara id="hyphenate-consecutive-vowels">
			<title>Hyphenate Consecutive Vowel Sounds</title>
			 <para>
				Hyphenate words where the prefix ends in a vowel and the word that follows begins with the same vowel. For example, semi-independent, pre-emptive.
			</para>

		</formalpara>
		 <note>
			<para>
				Exceptions to this rule include <emphasis>cooperate</emphasis> and <emphasis>coordinate.</emphasis>
			</para>

		</note>
		 <formalpara id="hyphenate-mixed-caps">
			<title>Hyphenate Mixed Capitalization</title>
			 <para>
				Hyphenate when the word that follows a prefix is capitalized. For example, un-American, non-British.
			</para>

		</formalpara>
		 <formalpara id="hyphenate-double-prefixes">
			<title>Hyphenate Double Prefixes</title>
			 <para>
				Hyphenate when the word has double prefixes. For example, sub-subparagraph, re-sublet.
			</para>

	 <section id="pronouns-gender-references">
		<title>Pronouns and Gender References</title>
		 <para>
			Do not use gender-specific pronouns in documentation, except to refer to a specific named user, such as in a case study.
      It is easier to read a sentence that uses "they" and "their" rather than "he/she" and "his/hers".
      It is acceptable to use "they" to refer to one person, with a plural verb. 
		</para>
		 <para>			
			Usually, when giving instructions, use the imperative mood or use "you".
      In more general explanations, you can use "users" or "new users".
      Do not use "one" in place of "you" when writing technical documentation, because it is too formal.
      Do not use "it" to refer to a person.
		</para>
		 <para>
			Avoid first person "I, we, our".
      Use second person "you" whenever possible. 
		</para>
		 <para>
			If referring to what Red&nbsp;Hat does, use "Red&nbsp;Hat" followed by a singular verb.

	 <section id="tense">
		<title>Tense</title>
		 <para>
			Avoid future tense (or using the term "will") whenever possible.
      For example, future tense ("The window will open ...") does not read as well as the present tense ("The window opens ...").
      Remember, the users you are writing for most often refer to the documentation while they are using the system, not after or in advance of using the system.
		</para>

		 <para>
			Use simple present tense as much as possible.
      It avoids problems with consequences and time-related communications, and is the easiest tense for translation.
