			<term>backtrace</term>
			 <listitem>
				<para>
					<emphasis>n.</emphasis> "Backtrace" is the most common term used to refer to a stack trace (or stack backtrace), which is a report of the active stack frames (that is, function calls) at a certain point in time during the execution of a program. In contrast, the Python programming language calls its stack trace a "traceback," possibly because the stack frames are printed in the opposite order of those presented by gdb, the GNU Debugger. "Traceback" is the preferred term when referring to a Python stack trace.

			<term>basically</term>
			 <listitem>
				<para>
					Do not use. For example, removing the word "basically" in the following sentence strengthens it: "This is how it is basically done." See also <xref linkend="varl-The_Red_Hat_Style_Guide-Conventions_for_Writers_and_Editors-S-simply" />.

			<term>bimodal IT</term>
			 <listitem>
				<para>
					Gartner phrase for the combination of traditional (mode 1 or type 1) and modern (mode 2 or type 2) IT infrastructure and resources.There are many ways to talk about this combination approach; be sure you use the right phrase for your audience. Using only the Gartner term can alienate other analysts or those not familar with Gartner's phrasing.
				</para>
				 <para>
					The practice of having both modes together is often referred to as hybrid, agile, or modern IT.
				</para>
				 <note>
					<para>
						Hybrid IT is a more general term, e.g. it could mean on-premise plus public cloud. Agile and modern IT can both carry an implication of "mode 2", so when using those terms, be specific about the exact technology combination you mean.

				 <para>
					A bottleneck refers to the delay in transmission of data through the circuits of a computer's microprocessor or over a TCP/IP network. The delay typically occurs when a system's bandwidth cannot support the amount of information being relayed at the speed it is being processed. There are, however, many factors that can create a bottleneck in a system.
