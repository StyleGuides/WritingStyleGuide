				<para>
					Initialism for Java Virtual Machine, and a registered trademark of Oracle Corporation. Due to this registration, rather than using "JVM" as a noun when referring to the virtual machine, use the full phrase "Java Virtual Machine," or "Java VM," or only the noun itself, "virtual machine." You can include "JVM" for clarity, because most people know it as such, for example, "Java Virtual Machine (JVM)." Do not use Jvm or jvm.
