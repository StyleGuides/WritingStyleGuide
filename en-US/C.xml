			 <listitem>
				<para>
					Use "can" to describe actions or conditions that are possible. Use "may" only to describe situations where permission is being given. If any of "can," "could," or "may" apply, use "can"; it is less tentative.
				</para>

			</listitem>

		</varlistentry>
		 <varlistentry id="cannot">
			<term>cannot</term>
			 <listitem>
				<para>
					Correct, as one word, when used in the negative form. For example, "you cannot end a sentence with a preposition." Do not use "can not." When used as an additive, use two words. For example, "you can not only end a sentence with a preposition, but you can also start a sentence with a conjunction."
				</para>

			</listitem>

		</varlistentry>
		 <varlistentry id="capex-opex">
			<term>CapEx, OpEx</term>
			 <listitem>

				</para>

			</listitem>

		</varlistentry>
		 <varlistentry id="cd">
			<term>cd, CD</term>
			 <listitem>

		</varlistentry>
		 <varlistentry id="cgroup">
			<term>cgroup</term>
			 <listitem>
				<para>
					Correct (all lowercase) when referring to the kernel-based technology. It is a contraction of control group, and not a proper noun in itself; proper nouns use initial caps. It is therefore permissible to capitalize it if used at the beginning of a sentence.
				</para>
				 <para>
					Where cgroup refers to something else, for example, a package name, file name, and so on, use a literal rendition.
				</para>

			</listitem>

		</varlistentry>
		 <varlistentry id="characters">
			<term>characters</term>
			 <listitem>

				</para>
				 <para>
					In computer software, any symbol that requires one byte of storage. This includes all the ASCII and extended ASCII characters, including the space character. In character-based software, everything that appears on the screen, including graphics symbols, is considered to be a character. In graphics-based applications, the term character is generally reserved for letters, numbers, and punctuation.

		</varlistentry>
		 <varlistentry id="clobber">

		</varlistentry>
		 <varlistentry id="cloud">
			<term>cloud</term>
			 <listitem>
				<para>

				<para>
					Define briefly on first use.
				</para>
				 <para>

						<ulink url="http://searchcloudcomputing.techtarget.com/definition/cloud-bursting" />
					</para>
					 </footnote>
				</para>

		</varlistentry>
		 <varlistentry id="csv">
			<term>comma-separated values (CSV)</term>
			 <listitem>
				<para>
					Use this in preference to "comma-delimited values" whenever possible. The initialism CSV is widely used to denote information that is broken up through use of commas.
