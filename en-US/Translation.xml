		<title>Sentence Structure</title>

			<title>Using and Formatting Lists</title>
			 <para>
				Lists appear in a range of formats, such as series, ordered, unordered (itemized), and so on. Avoid using itemized lists to format a single sentence. Some translation tools display list items and the introductory sentence (or <firstterm>sentence stem</firstterm>) as individual sentences for translation. If they are not complete sentences, they can be difficult to translate.
			</para>
      <para>
        The following general guidelines apply to lists:
      </para>
      <variablelist>
        <varlistentry>
            <term>Itemized lists</term>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                  They appear as a bulleted list.
                  Use this list type for three or more entries where order is not important, or in a demonstration section when students are encouraged not to perform steps but to watch the instructor instead.
                  Titles are optional.
                </para>
            </listitem>
        </varlistentry>
        <varlistentry>
            <term>Ordered lists</term>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                    They appear as a numbered list.
                    Use this list type for multiple entries if you need to refer to one of the entries from elsewhere in your document, or where order is important.
                    For example, if you need to list the order of operations that are required to prepare for an installation, or list a sequence of events that occurs.
                    Titles are optional.
                </para>
            </listitem>
        </varlistentry>
        <varlistentry>
            <term>Variable lists</term>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                  They appear as a list of terms followed by definitions.
                  Use this list type to list and describe a series of terms, such as variables, command options or arguments, and similar items.
                  Titles are optional.
                  (This list is written as a variable list.)
                  A variable list is often preferable to a table, because tables have the additional overhead of calculating column width for every translation.
                  Tables are best reserved for information that relies on, or benefits greatly from, a grid layout.
                </para>
            </listitem>
        </varlistentry>
        <varlistentry>
            <term>Procedures</term>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                    They appear as a list of numbered steps.
                    Procedures always include a title, and are used to list the required steps to achieve a task.
                </para>
            </listitem>
        </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>
    <para>
        You can nest lists, but try to keep the number of levels to two or fewer.
        To nest procedures in DocBook, use &lt;substep&gt; elements.
    </para>
    <section><title>Formatting Lists for Readability</title>
      <para>
        It is important to provide sufficient spacing between elements in your documents to facilitate reading and comprehension.
        You can include a lot of information in a few short paragraphs but readers need to be able to process that information in chunks.
        The same consideration applies to lists.
      </para>
      <para>
        In some authoring environments, you can choose between normal or compact spacing for lists.
		Use a list with normal spacing if any list item contains the following components:
      </para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Nested lists.
            Nested lists themselves can use the <option>compact</option> attribute if they fall outside the bounds of these recommendations.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Navigation or similar instructions (such as "Navigate to Menu -> Submenu").
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Multiple paragraphs, or sentences that wrap to two or more lines.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>
        Use a list with compact spacing in all other cases.
      </para>
      <note>
        <para>
          The use of all but the simplest graphics in lists is strongly discouraged.
        </para>

	 <section id="genders">
		<title>Grammatical Genders</title>
		 <para>
			When using ambiguous pronouns such as "they" or "it", it is not always clear what they refer to. For languages that have different genders for nouns, it is important to know exactly what each pronoun refers to. For example, the word "it" can be translated in several different ways and might require other grammatical adjustments.
		</para>
		 <para>
			Further, an initialism such as <emphasis>RPM</emphasis> might refer to the package or to the package manager. In German, <emphasis>manager</emphasis> is a masculine noun, and so RPM requires the masculine article "der" when it refers to the RPM Package Manager. <emphasis>Package</emphasis> is a neuter noun, and requires the neuter article "das" when it refers to an RPM package.

		<title>Entities</title>
		 <para>
			An entity is a primitive data type, which associates a string with either a unique alias (such as a user-specified name) or an SGML reserved word (such as #DEFAULT)<footnote> <para>
				<ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SGML_entity" />
			</para>
			 </footnote>. Entities are called by reference, and take the form &amp;name; (both the ampersand and the semicolon are required).
		</para>
<!-- Is this information still useful and needed? -->
		 <para>
			Entities can be helpful in some cases, but they are more of a hindrance when used for terms that need translation. Translators must compare the string with the built document to determine what the entity stands for. These entities might even be overlooked and not be translated at all.
		</para>
		 <para>
			To avoid issues with incorrect or outdated entity values, problems with translation, and so on, only include the entities that are required to build your books. If you use Publican (<ulink url="https://fedorahosted.org/publican/" />) to create and maintain your documentation, it creates and populates the required entities with default values when you create a book. Required entities vary by brand; only the following entities are required for a standard book:
		</para>
		 <itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					PRODUCT
				</para>

			</listitem>
			 <listitem>
				<para>
					BOOKID
				</para>

			</listitem>
			 <listitem>
				<para>
					YEAR
				</para>

			</listitem>
			 <listitem>
				<para>
					HOLDER
				</para>

			</listitem>

		</itemizedlist>
		 <para>
			Do not include entities such as &amp;PRODNAME; or &amp;VERSION; and so on, or things like &amp;BIBLE; to represent "The King James Bible". To learn more about entities, see the relevant chapter in <ulink url="http://jfearn.fedorapeople.org/en-US/Publican/4.0/html/Users_Guide/index.html" />
