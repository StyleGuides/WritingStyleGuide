					InfiniBand is a switched fabric network topology that is used in high-performance computing. The term is both a service mark and a trademark of the InfiniBand Trade Association. Their rules for using the mark are standard ones: append the ™ symbol the first time that it is used and respect the capitalization (including the inter-capped "B") from then on. In ASCII-only circumstances, the "(TM)" string is the acceptable alternative.

		</varlistentry>
		 <varlistentry id="io">
			<term>I/O</term>
			 <listitem>
				<para>
					Correct. Stands for input/output (pronounced "eye-oh"). The term "I/O" is used to describe any program, operation, or device that transfers data to or from a computer and to or from a peripheral device. Every transfer is an output from one device and an input into another. Devices such as keyboards and mice are input-only devices, while devices such as printers are output-only. A writable CD is both an input and an output device.
				</para>
				 <para>
					The term "I/O" is a non-countable noun. Append "operations" to refer to multiple units of I/O. For example: I/O operations could not be recovered in situations where I/O should have been temporarily queued, such as when paths were unavailable.
				</para>

			</listitem>

		</varlistentry>
		 <varlistentry id="iops">
			<term>IOPS</term>

			</listitem>

		</varlistentry>
		 <varlistentry id="ip-masquerade">
			<term>IP Masquerade</term>
			 <listitem>
				<para>
					A Linux networking function. IP Masquerade, also called IPMASQ or MASQ, allows one or more computers in a network without assigned IP addresses to communicate with the internet by using the Linux server's assigned IP address. The IPMASQ server acts as a gateway, and the other devices are invisible behind it, so to other machines on the internet the outgoing traffic appears to be coming from the IPMASQ server and not from the internal PCs.
				</para>
				 <para>
					Because IPMASQ is a generic technology, the server can be connected to other computers through LAN technologies such as Ethernet, Token-Ring, and FDDI, as well as dial-up connections such as PPP or SLIP.
				</para>

			</listitem>

		</varlistentry>
		 <varlistentry id="ipsec">
			<term>IPsec</term>

			<term>IP switching</term>
			 <listitem>
				<para>
					A type of IP routing that Ipsilon Networks, Inc. developed. Unlike conventional routers, IP switching routers use ATM hardware to speed packets through networks. This type of IP routing appears to be considerably faster than older router techniques.
				</para>

		 <varlistentry id="ITI.T.">
			<term>IT/I.T.</term>
			 <listitem>
				<para>
					Use "I.T." (with periods) only in headlines or subheadings where all caps are used, to clarify that the word is "IT" versus "it".
				</para>

			</listitem>

		</varlistentry>
		 <varlistentry id="itanium">
			<term>Itanium</term>
			 <listitem>
				<para>
					A member of Intel's Merced family of processors, Itanium is a 64-bit RISC microprocessor. Based on the EPIC (Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing) design philosophy, which states that the compiler should decide which instructions should be executed together, Itanium has the highest FPU power available.
				</para>
				 <para>
					In 64-bit mode, Itanium can calculate two bundles of a maximum of three instructions at a time. In 32-bit mode, it is much slower. Decoders must first translate 32-bit instruction sets into 64-bit instruction sets, which results in extra-clock cycle use.
				</para>
				 <para>
					Itanium's primary use is driving large applications that require more than 4 GB of memory, such as databases, ERP, and future internet applications.
				</para>
				 <para>
					Do not use the term "IA64". It can be used in file names because they are not printed in the content.
				</para>

			</listitem>

		</varlistentry>
		 <varlistentry id="itanium2">
			<term>Itanium&nbsp;2</term>
			 <listitem>
				<para>
					Itanium&nbsp;2 is correct. Do not use "Itanium2" and always use a non-breaking space between "Itanium" and "2".
				</para>
