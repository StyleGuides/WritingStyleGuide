			 <listitem>
				<para>
					Correct. Do not use "Ram" or any other variations. It is an acronym for "random access memory".

			 <listitem>
				<para>
					Correct. Do not use "RAMdisk", "ramdisk", or "RAdisk".
				</para>
				 <para>
					Refers to RAM that is configured to simulate a disk drive. You can access files on a RAM disk as you would access files on a real disk. RAM disks, however, are approximately a thousand times faster than hard disk drives. They are particularly useful, therefore, for applications that require frequent disk accesses.
				</para>

		 <varlistentry id="raw">
			<term>raw</term>
			 <listitem>
				<para>

				</para>
				 <para>

			 <listitem>
				<para>

			<term>remote access</term>
			 <listitem>
				<para>
					The ability to log on to a network from a distant location. Generally, it implies a computer, a modem, and some remote access software to connect to the network. Whereas remote control refers to taking control of another computer, remote access means that the remote computer becomes a full-fledged host on the network. The remote access software dials in directly to the network server. The only difference between a remote host and workstations that are connected directly to the network is slower data transfer speeds.
