		<varlistentry id="ram">

			 <listitem>
				<para>
					Correct. Do not use "Ram" or any other variations. It is an acronym for "random access memory".

			<term>RAM disk</term>
			 <listitem>
				<para>
					Correct. Do not use "RAMdisk", "ramdisk", or "RAdisk".
				</para>
				 <para>
					Refers to RAM that is configured to simulate a disk drive. You can access files on a RAM disk as you would access files on a real disk. RAM disks, however, are approximately a thousand times faster than hard disk drives. They are particularly useful, therefore, for applications that require frequent disk accesses.
				</para>

		 <varlistentry id="raw">
			<term>raw</term>
			 <listitem>
				<para>
					Unprocessed. The term refers to data that is passed to an I/O device without being interpreted. In contrast, cooked refers to data that is processed before being passed to the I/O device.
				</para>
				 <para>
					The term can also refer to information that is not organized, formatted, or analyzed.
				</para>
				 <para>
					The term comes from UNIX, which supports cooked and raw modes for data output to a terminal. In cooked mode, special characters, such as erase and kill, are processed by the device driver before being sent to the output device.

		 <varlistentry id="read-only">
			<term>read-only</term>
			 <listitem>
				<para>

		</varlistentry>
		 <varlistentry id="readwrite">
			<term>read/write</term>
			 <listitem>
				<para>
					Capable of being displayed (read) and modified (written to). Most objects (disks, files, or directories) are read/write, but you can also protect objects with a read-only attribute that prevents other users from modifying the object.

			<term>real time, real-time</term>
			 <listitem>
				<para>

				</para>
				 <para>
					<emphasis>adj.</emphasis> Use the hyphenated version. For example, "XEmacs is a self-documenting, customizable, extensible, real-time display editor."

			<term>remote access</term>
			 <listitem>
				<para>
					The ability to log on to a network from a distant location. Generally, it implies a computer, a modem, and some remote access software to connect to the network. Whereas remote control refers to taking control of another computer, remote access means that the remote computer becomes a full-fledged host on the network. The remote access software dials in directly to the network server. The only difference between a remote host and workstations that are connected directly to the network is slower data transfer speeds.

		 <varlistentry id="rom-prom">
			<term>ROM, PROM</term>
			 <listitem>

					Acronym for read-only memory, computer memory on which data is prerecorded. After data has been written to a ROM chip, it cannot be removed and can only be read.
				</para>
				 <para>
