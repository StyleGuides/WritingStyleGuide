		<title>Heading Styles</title>
		 <para>
			This section covers various aspects of heading styles and design. If your company or organization has specific requirements in this regard, follow those requirements first.
		</para>
		 <formalpara id="capitalization">
			<title>Capitalization</title>
			 <para>
				The standard for all Red&nbsp;Hat technical documentation is title case for all headings and titles. Diagram labels, table headings, procedure, and formal paragraph titles all fall under this heading, and consequently, standard title case capitalization rules apply. The currently accepted reference for determining title case is at <ulink url="https://titlecase.com/titlecase">https://titlecase.com/titlecase.</ulink>
			</para>
			 <!--  Added that sentence case is required for captions, legends, and diagram labels.  -->
		</formalpara>
		 <para>
			Use sentence case for captions, legends, diagram labels, and table column headers. They are not classified as titles.
		</para>
		 <warning>
			<title>Marketing and Brand Capitalization Guide</title>
			 <para>
				The Red&nbsp;Hat Marketing and Brand groups use sentence case for most titles and headings, with some exceptions, for example, when referencing an externally produced resource's title.
			</para>

		</warning>
		 <formalpara>
			<title>Punctuation</title>
			 <para>
				Be frugal with punctuation. In most cases, avoid semicolons, colons, dashes, and similar punctuation unless part of the actual subject, or a proper name. Do not use terminating periods.
			</para>

		</formalpara>
		 <formalpara id="imperative-mood">
			<title>Avoid Imperative Mood</title>
			 <para>
				Use the gerund form (noun form of verb) for titles, not the imperative mood. For example, "Testing the Product", not "Test the Product".
			</para>
			<!--  Added an example.  -->
		</formalpara>
		 <para>
			See the <citetitle>IBM Style Guide</citetitle> for more information.

		 <formalpara>
			<title>File Names, Commands, and Related Terms</title>
			 <para>
				When creating chapter and section titles, do not include file, command, or similar names, and do not include DocBook elements. Instead, focus on the task at hand and introduce the required file and command names in the text. Including such objects in titles is generally considered poor technical writing practice. Depending on how your documentation is built and delivered, including these object types can result in unpredictable results and can even cause failed builds.
			</para>

		</formalpara>

	 <section id="documenting-fonts">
		<title>Documenting Fonts</title>
		 <para>
			The preferred way to refer to each type of PostScript font is "PostScript Type x," substituting "x" with either 1, 2, or 3, if the problem is specific to a particular type.

		</para>
		 <section id="gui-elements-punctuation">
			<title>GUI Elements, Punctuation, and Symbols</title>
			 <para>
				When describing GUI elements, do not include punctuation that appears on those elements, unless omission of that punctuation might lead to confusion.
			</para>
			 <para>
				For example, for a button labeled <guibutton>Save As...</guibutton>, do not include the ellipsis in the documentation.
			</para>
			 <para>
				In most cases, do not include the object type in instructions. For example, rather than "Click the <guibutton>Save</guibutton> button," write "Click <guibutton>Save</guibutton>."
			</para>
			 <para>
				In some cases it is preferred practice to include the object type for the sake of clarity. Consider the following:
			</para>
			 <example>
				<title>Preferred Style for Documenting Symbols and Other Special Characters</title>
				 <para>
					Click the <guibutton>+</guibutton> sign.
				</para>
				 <para>
					Click the <guibutton>^</guibutton> symbol.
				</para>

			</example>
			 <para>
				If you cannot easily reproduce the symbol, include a screen capture, or a succinct description of the object type, or both. Use this approach for icons, especially when they have no tooltip or other help text.
			</para>
			 <example>
				<title>Preferred Style for Documenting Icons</title>
				 <para>
					Click the <guiicon>Upload</guiicon> (<guiicon>
					<inlinemediaobject>
						<imageobject>
							<imagedata fileref="images/reload.png" format="PNG" />

			 <section>
				<title>Navigating Through Multiple GUI Options</title>
				 <para>
					Use "Navigate to" when moving through multiple GUI options because it covers all cases where you might have to click, point to, press, select, or otherwise make a series of selections to initiate an action.

			<title>Starting Applications from the Desktop</title>
			 <para>
				This section describes how to start applications from a Red&nbsp;Hat Enterprise&nbsp;Linux-based distribution.
			</para>
			 <para>
				RHEL&nbsp;8 uses the following approach to starting applications from the desktop. In an effort to maintain consistency and to make translation easier, Red&nbsp;Hat documentation assumes use of GNOME Classic, the default user interface, and prefers a consistent approach to instructing customers how to start applications.
			</para>
			 <para>
				The preferred approach is to use the <keycap>Super</keycap> key to enter the Activities Overview, to enter the name of the required application, and to press <keycap>Enter</keycap>. The <keycap>Super</keycap> key appears in various guises, depending on the keyboard and other hardware, but often as either the <keysym>Windows</keysym> or <keysym>Command</keysym> key, and typically to the left of the <keycap>Spacebar</keycap>. For example:

				Sufficient variation exists in the terminology that is used to describe commands, options, arguments, and so on that only general advice is provided here.
			</para>
			 <para>
				When referring to the command line as specified by Bash and POSIX, follow the terminology that the software uses. Never use "flag" when referring to command-line options in POSIX, even though Microsoft often uses the term "flag" when referring to single-character options in Microsoft Windows.
			</para>
			 <para>
				The following extract from <command>info libc</command> is of particular interest here:
			</para>
			 <blockquote>
				<para>
					"POSIX recommends these conventions for command line arguments. [...] Arguments are options if they begin with a hyphen delimiter (‘-’). Multiple options may follow a hyphen delimiter in a single token if the options do not take arguments. Thus, ‘-abc’ is equivalent to ‘-a -b -c’. [...] Certain options require an argument. For example, the ‘-o’ option of the ‘ld’ command requires an argument—an output file name." and so on.

		<title>Using Abbreviations, Acronyms, and Initialisms Correctly</title>
		 <para>
			This section describes how to use abbreviations, acronyms, and initialisms correctly in Red&nbsp;Hat documentation.
		</para>
		 <formalpara>
			<title>Abbreviations</title>
			 <para>
				An abbreviation is a shortened form of a word or phrase. For example, <abbrev>Pty.</abbrev> and <abbrev>Inc.</abbrev> are abbreviations for "proprietary" and "incorporated," respectively. Read them as the word for which they are an abbreviation.
			</para>

		</formalpara>
		 <formalpara id="acronyms">
			<title>Acronyms</title>
			 <para>
				What are acronyms anyway? They are similar to abbreviations and initialisms but they are pronounced as a word. An acronym is a word that is formed from the initial letters of a name, such as ROM for <emphasis>R</emphasis>ead <emphasis>O</emphasis>nly <emphasis>M</emphasis>emory, or by combining initial letters or part of a series of words, such as LILO for <emphasis>LI</emphasis>nux <emphasis>LO</emphasis>ader. <acronym>COBOL</acronym> is the acronym for Common Business-oriented Language, and <acronym>POP</acronym> is the acronym for Post Office Protocol.
			</para>

		</formalpara>
		 <para>
			Consider pronunciation when using articles. For example, use "an <abbrev>RTS</abbrev> (real-time strategy)," because <abbrev>RTS</abbrev> is an initialism and you pronounce the first character as an "R" (är). Conversely, use "a <acronym>RAM</acronym> upgrade," because <acronym>RAM</acronym> is an acronym and you pronounce it as a word (răm).
		</para>
		 <para>
			Spell out most acronyms and initialisms before using them in text, such as "The Embedded DevKit (EDK) ..." Unless the acronym or initialism stands for a proper noun, use sentence case for the spelled out version: for example, "central processing unit (CPU)." Unless required for the audience or the topic, do not spell out well-known abbreviations, such as HTML.
		</para>
		 <para>
			To form the plural of an acronym, add a trailing, lowercase "s" or "es" without an apostrophe, for example, ROMs, PINs, BIOSes.
		</para>
		 <para>
			Be sure to use correct capitalization for acronyms. Not all acronyms are capitalized (for example, "spool"); see the <citetitle>IBM Style Guide</citetitle> or another suitable reference if you are unsure.
		</para>
		 <formalpara>
			<title>Initialisms</title>
			 <para>
				An initialism is an abbreviation that consists of the first letters of words in a phrase, syllables, or some combination thereof. Each character is pronounced separately. For example, <abbrev>FTP</abbrev> is an initialism for <systemitem class="protocol">File Transfer Protocol.</systemitem>
			</para>

		</formalpara>
		 <para>
			Consider pronunciation when using articles. See <xref linkend="acronyms" /> for more information.

		<title>Using Company, Product, and Brand Names Correctly</title>
		 <para>
			Various restrictions apply to using company, product, and brand names in Red&nbsp;Hat documentation. Refer to internal sources for further conditions that might apply to your own products.
		</para>
		 <note>
			<para>
				In the following sections, "first use" refers to the first use of a name in body text. Titles, banners, and similar objects are not classified as "first use."
			</para>

		</note>
		 <itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					Restrictions apply to abbreviating Red&nbsp;Hat product or solution names in public-facing documents. Always use the full name on first use. For some products, for example Red&nbsp;Hat OpenShift Container Platform, you can omit "Red&nbsp;Hat" after the first use.
				</para>

			</listitem>
			 <listitem>
				<para>
					Further restrictions apply to using acronyms and initialisms. In this same example, and only in technical documentation, "RHOCP" is acceptable after the first use of the full product name.
				</para>

			</listitem>
			 <listitem>
				<para>
					Do not include "Inc." when referring to Red&nbsp;Hat except in legal documents.
				</para>

			</listitem>
			 <listitem>
				<para>
					Use non-breaking spaces to avoid breaking the company name, or product names and their versions, over multiple lines. For example, use a non-breaking space between "Red" and "Hat," and also between "Enterprise," "Linux," and the version number.
				</para>
				 <para>
					If you are working with images or other objects where space is especially tight, this rule is more flexible, but "Red&nbsp;Hat" should never be broken over two lines.
				</para>

			</listitem>
			 <listitem>
				<para>
					Do not use non-breaking spaces between "Red&nbsp;Hat" and any product name. Consider the following DocBook XML examples:
				</para>
				 <itemizedlist>
					<listitem>
						<para>
							Standardize on Red&amp;nbsp;Hat Enterprise&amp;nbsp;Linux.
						</para>

					</listitem>
					 <listitem>
						<para>
							The latest version is Red&amp;nbsp;Hat Enterprise&amp;nbsp;Linux&amp;nbsp;8.0
						</para>

					</listitem>

				</itemizedlist>
				 <para>
					For other markup languages, use the equivalent non-breaking space character.
				</para>

			</listitem>
			 <listitem>
				<para>
					Do not use non-breaking spaces between extended components of Red&nbsp;Hat product names. For example, "Red&nbsp;Hat Enterprise&nbsp;Linux OpenStack Platform" does not require a non-breaking space between "Linux" and "OpenStack", nor between "OpenStack" and "Platform."
				</para>

			</listitem>
			 <listitem>
				<para>
					Do not use non-breaking spaces with other companies' product names.
				</para>

			</listitem>
			 <listitem>
				<para>
					Do not use articles in front of product names. For example, do not write "the JBoss Enterprise&nbsp;Application&nbsp;Platform was..."
				</para>
				 <note>
					<para>
						In this case, "Platform" is part of the product name. In other cases, words like "platform," "manager," and so on might not be part of the product name, in which case an article is acceptable, if not necessary.
					</para>

				</note>

			</listitem>

		</itemizedlist>

	</section>
	 <section id="version-numbers">
		<title>Using Version Numbers Correctly</title>
		 <para>
			The preferred format for product names includes only the major version number. For example: 
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Red&nbsp;Hat Enterprise&nbsp;Linux&nbsp;8
					</para>

				</listitem>
				 <listitem>
					<para>
						JBoss Enterprise&nbsp;Application&nbsp;Platform&nbsp;3
					</para>

				</listitem>

			</itemizedlist>

		</para>
		 <para>
			When writing about a product line, product release, or product family, use major version numbers. It includes all the releases (past, present, and future) of that major version.
		</para>
		 <para>
			Only use minor version numbers when you are referring to a specific minor release, or to a feature that is specific to that minor release. For example: 
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Red&nbsp;Hat Enterprise&nbsp;Linux&nbsp;5.2 was released on October 12, 2010.
					</para>

				</listitem>
				 <listitem>
					<para>
						&lt;Application name&gt; was first included in JBoss Enterprise&nbsp;Application&nbsp;Platform&nbsp;3.2.
					</para>

				</listitem>

			</itemizedlist>

		</para>
		 <para>
			In most cases, major changes take place in major version releases, and are carried through any minor updates to that release. If you are referring to a major change, or to the first appearance of a new technology, it is therefore most accurate to refer to the major release.
		</para>
		 <para>
			Avoid using the "dot-oh" release number. For example, do not use Red&nbsp;Hat Enterprise&nbsp;Linux&nbsp;6.0. Use instead Red&nbsp;Hat Enterprise&nbsp;Linux&nbsp;6.
		</para>
		 <important>
			<para>
				This rule applies only to Red&nbsp;Hat products. Refer to other companies' products and use their version numbers as they use them.
			</para>

					<para>
						Use a <command>Note</command> admonition to bring additional information to the user's attention.
					</para>

				</listitem>
				 <listitem>
					<para>
						Use an <command>Important</command> admonition to show the user a piece of information that should not be overlooked. While this information might not change anything that the user is doing, it should show the user that this piece of information could be vital.
					</para>

				</listitem>
				 <listitem>
					<para>
						Use a <command>Warning</command> admonition to alert the reader that the current setup will change or be altered, such as files being removed, and not to perform the operation unless fully aware of the consequences.
