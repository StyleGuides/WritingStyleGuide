		 <varlistentry id="varl-Red_Hat_Technical_Publications-Writing_Style_Guide-B-backtrace">
			<term>backtrace</term>
			 <listitem>
				<para>
					Correct. "Backtrace" is the most common term used to refer to a stack trace (or stack backtrace), which is a report of the active stack frames (that is, function calls) at a certain point in time during the execution of a program. In contrast, the Python programming language calls its stack trace a "traceback," possibly because the stack frames are printed in the opposite order of those presented by gdb, the GNU Debugger. "Traceback" is the preferred term when referring to a Python stack trace.

				<para>
					Gartner phrase for the combination of traditional (mode 1 or type 1) and modern (mode 2 or type 2) IT infrastructure and resources.There are many ways to talk about this combination approach; be sure you use the right phrase for your audience.
